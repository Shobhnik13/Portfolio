      I’m a software engineer with a passion for building (and occasionally breaking) innovative products. While I’m comfortable across the stack, I specialize in backend development, designing scalable systems, crafting clean APIs, tackling complex data challenges, and following to LLD & HLD principles. With over 2 years of experience, I’ve leveraged modern web technologies to deliver fast, reliable, and practical solutions that make a real impact.
